	/* Abstract method must be overridden by all subclasses.
	 * Concept of the method is to return all valid locations that the given piece could move to if it were the only piece on the board.
	 * The design choice that I made was to separate the board logic from the pieces such that a piece would return all moves that it can legally make
	 * without taking into account where the other pieces are, and then the board makes decisions about which moves the piece can actually make
	 * based on the locations of the other pieces.
	 * Specifically, the moves are returned as an array of arrays, where each of the constituent arrays contain moves that the piece can make in a specific
	 * direction. Thus, code of the form:
	 * ArrayList<ArrayList<Location>> moves = piece.validMoves();
